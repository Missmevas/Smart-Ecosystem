###  Smart Eco System 

> The fundamental high-level aim of the Smart Eco System project was creating a product that would
meet the needs of modern gardeners; both digitalized Millennials just discovering the world of plants,
as well as older members of society experienced in the field, but wary of new technologies. In practice,
the project aim is to deliver a device that would collect environmental data on a plant and place the 
readings into a database. This data would then be used by a web interface to power intuitive and
visually-attractive graphs. The complete system itself, being the outcome of the project, will give the
user the means to monitor their plants as precisely and meticulously as if they were placed in a
scientific laboratory. For an experienced gardener, such an opportunity could become the beginning
of plant growth optimization, which could potentially save them time and money.
